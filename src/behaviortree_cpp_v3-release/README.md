# BehaviorTree.CPP

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/ReadTheDocs.png"></p>

This  __C++ 14__ library provides a framework to create BehaviorTrees.
It was designed to be flexible, easy to use, reactive and fast.

Even if our main use-case is __robotics__, you can use this library to build
__AI for games__, or to replace Finite State Machines in your application.

There are few features that make __BehaviorTree.CPP__ unique, when compared to other implementations:

- It makes __asynchronous Actions__, i.e. non-blocking, a first-class citizen.

- You can build __reactive__ behaviors that execute multiple Actions concurrently.

- Trees are defined using a Domain Specific Scripting __scripting language__ (based on XML), and can be loaded at run-time; in other words, even if written in C++, Trees are _not_ hard-coded.

- You can statically link your custom TreeNodes or convert them into __plugins__
which can be loaded at run-time.

- It provides a type-safe and flexible mechanism to do __Dataflow__ between
  Nodes of the Tree.

- It includes a __logging/profiling__ infrastructure that allows the user 
to visualize, record, replay and analyze state transitions.

- Last but not least: it is well [documented](https://www.behaviortree.dev/)!

## Documentation

You can learn about the main concepts, the API and the tutorials here: https://www.behaviortree.dev/

To find more details about the conceptual ideas that make this implementation different from others,
you can read the [final deliverable of the project MOOD2Be](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/blob/master/MOOD2Be_final_report.pdf).

## Forum and Community

If the documentation doesn't answer your questions and/or you want to
connect with the other **BT.CPP** users, visit https://discourse.behaviortree.dev/

## Commercial support

Are you using BT.CPP in your commercial product and you need technical support / consulting?
You can get in touch at dfaconti@aurynrobotics.com and we will happy to discuss your use case and needs.

# Design principles

The main goal of this project is to create a Behavior Tree implementation
that uses the principles of Model Driven Development to separate the role 
of the __Component Developer__ from the __Behavior Designer__.

In practice, this means that:

- Custom TreeNodes must be reusable building blocks. 
 You should be able to implement them once and reuse them to build many behaviors.

- To build a Behavior Tree out of TreeNodes, the Behavior Designer must 
not need to read nor modify the C++ source code of a given TreeNode.

- Complex Behaviours must be composable using Subtrees

Many of the features and, sometimes, the apparent limitations of this library, might be a consequence 
of this design principle. 

For instance, having a scoped BlackBoard, visible only in a portion of the tree, is particularly important 
to avoid "name pollution" and allow the creation of large scale trees.

# GUI Editor

Editing a BehaviorTree is as simple as editing a XML file in your favourite text editor.

If you are looking for a more fancy graphical user interface (and I know you do) check 
[Groot](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot) out.

the graphic user interface are used to design and monitor a Behavior Tree.

# How to compile (plain old cmake)

On Ubuntu, you are encourage to install the following dependencies:

     sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev libboost-dev
     
Other dependencies are already included in the __3rdparty__ folder.

To compile and install the library, from the BehaviorTree.CPP folder, execute:

     mkdir build; cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     sudo make install

If you want to use BT.CPp in your application a typical **CMakeLists.txt** file 
will look like this:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)

project(hello_BT)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
find_package(behaviortree_cpp_v3)

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} "hello_BT.cpp")
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} BT::behaviortree_cpp_v3)
```

## ROS1 or ROS2 users (Catkin/Ament)

You can easily install the package with the command

      sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-behaviortree-cpp-v3
      
If you want to compile it with catkin, you __must__ include this package 
to your catkin workspace.

# Acknowledgement

This library was initially developed at  **Eurecat - https://eurecat.org/en/** (main author, Davide Faconti) in a joint effort
with the **Italian Institute of Technology** (Michele Colledanchise).

This software is one of the main components of [MOOD2Be](https://eurecat.org/en/portfolio-items/mood2be/),
which is one of the six **Integrated Technical Projects (ITPs)** selected from the
[RobMoSys first open call](https://robmosys.eu/itp/). Therefore, MOOD2Be has been supported by the European Horizon2020 project RobMoSys. This software is RobMoSys conformant.
